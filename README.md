# Humble Bundle Library Steam View
Adds game information of Steam games in the Humble Bundle library.  

I was getting annoyed very often that, whenever I was browsing through my Humble Bundle library with 300+ titles, I had to look up every Steam game individually. So last sunday I finally snapped and wrote a very simple javascript plugin for Firefox that displays a little gallery alongside the game's description and its banner.

If you were just as annoyed as me, feel free to check it out!
